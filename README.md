# IR Sensor Obstacle Detection Project

This project utilizes an IR (Infrared) sensor to detect obstacles using Atmel microcontrollers and is simulated in Proteus. The IR sensor detects the presence of objects or obstacles within its range and provides feedback to the microcontroller, which then triggers appropriate actions or displays the obstacle status on a simulated LCD in Proteus.

## Features

- Detects obstacles using an IR sensor
- Atmel microcontroller-based implementation
- Simulated in Proteus for testing and verification
- Displays obstacle status on a simulated LCD screen
- Supports obstacle detection in real-time
- Configurable detection threshold for obstacle detection sensitivity
- Easy to use and integrate into other projects

## Hardware Requirements

- Atmel microcontroller (e.g., ATmega32)
- IR sensor module
- LCD display module
- Resistors, capacitors, and other required components
- Jumper wires and breadboard

## Software Requirements

- Atmel Studio or any compatible IDE for Atmel microcontroller programming
- Proteus Design Suite for circuit simulation

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone or download the project repository.
2. Open the project in Atmel Studio or your preferred IDE.
3. Configure the project settings and build the code.
4. Simulate the circuit in Proteus by opening the provided Proteus project file.
5. Connect the virtual LCD display and the IR sensor module to the appropriate pins on the microcontroller in Proteus.
6. Power up the simulation and observe the obstacle detection status on the virtual LCD display.
